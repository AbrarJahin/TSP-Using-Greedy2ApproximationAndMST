# Travelling Salesman Problem using Greedy 2 Approximation (using Minimum Spanning Tree)

This code is a Greedy 2 Approximation (using Minimum Spanning Tree) implementation of Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). I have made this code as easy to understand as I can. Well commits are added. Input can be taken by 2 ways, from file or from user.

Both of them are done by functions. Currently file input is enabled and random generated input is disabled. You can use any one as you can, but don't use both together.

If any problem or query, please ask me, I will try my best to answer the question.

Happy coading!!!
